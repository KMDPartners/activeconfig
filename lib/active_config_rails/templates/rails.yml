# If you need to set a rails env for a host
# make a host override of this file and
# set the env key.  This will not override
# the RAILS_ENV environment variable.
#
# On the other hand, force_env WILL override the 
# RAILS_ENV environment variable.  In short, 
# both of thse are crazy dangerous if they 
# aren't in a host override.  In fact, force_env
# is probably pretty close to bat-shit-crazy.
